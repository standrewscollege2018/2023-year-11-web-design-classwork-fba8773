        <h1>Trip to Europe</h1>
        <p>I was lucky enough to visit Europe last year and wanted to share some of my experiences and photos</p>
        <p>Some of the countries I visited were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>United Kingdom</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>Greece</li>
            <li>France</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!</p>
        <p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>
        <h2>Italy</h2>
